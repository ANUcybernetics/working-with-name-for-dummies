# Working with `$NAME` for Dummies

Make a booklet to tell us about how best to work with you.

Riffing on the [Dummies series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies), but
obviously this is a bit tongue-in-cheek.

## Usage

If your name is say, Ben, then you can compile the booklet with:

```
typst compile --input name=Ben booklet.typ
```
